# DecryptZero

## Introduction
DecryptZero is a **fully open-source** OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model for chess tournament notation sheets. DecryptZero runs on a model trained specifically to read chess players' handwriting (which can get very messy at times!) through the open-source [deep-text-recognition-benchmark](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark) repo.
